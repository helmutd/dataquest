* [Analyzing NYC High School Data](https://github.com/helmutd/dataquest/blob/master/Analyzing%20NYC%20High%20School%20Data.ipynb)
	* New York City has a significant immigrant population and is very diverse, so comparing demographic factors such as race, income, and gender with SAT scores is a good way to determine whether the SAT is a fair test. For example, if certain racial groups consistently perform better on the SAT, we would have some evidence that the SAT is unfair  


* [Star Wars Survey](https://github.com/helmutd/dataquest/blob/master/Star%20Wars%20Survey.ipynb)
	* Analyzing data on Star Wars movies
