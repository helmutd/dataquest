    "In order to get from the raw counts of gun deaths by race to a rate of gun deaths per 100000 people in each race, we'll need to divide the total number of gun deaths by the population of each race. From the census dataset, we know that the number of people in the White racial category is 197318956. We'd divide 66237 by 197318956:\n",

If you do this computation, you'll see that the rate is a very small number, 0.0003356849303419181. It's for this reason that it's typical to express crime statistics as the \"rate per 100000\". This tells you the number of people in a given group out of every 100000 that were killed by guns in the US. To get this, we just multiply by 100000:\n",

    "\n",
    "We'll need to calculate these same rates for each racial category. The only stumbling block is that the racial categories are named slightly differently in census and in data. We'll need to manually construct a dictionary that allows us to map between them, and perform the division.\n",
